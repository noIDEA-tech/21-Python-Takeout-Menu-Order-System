## Description
This command-line Python application simulates a restaurant ordering system. The program allows users to view a menu, select items, specify quantities, and receive an itemized receipt with a calculated total. The application is designed with accessibility in mind, particularly for customers with hearing and vocal impairments who may prefer to interact with a digital interface rather than verbally communicating their order.
